This is a draft of a paper about an optimal method for modeling gravitational
fields due to spherical prism mass elements (tesseroids).

## Reproducing the results

All results and figures in this paper were generated with
[IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) located in the
`notebooks` directory of this repository.
They use [Tesseroids](http://www.leouieda.com/tesseroids) and
[Fatiando a Terra](http://fatiando.org) to perform the calculations.
Data generated by the notebooks is stored in subdirectories in `notebooks`.
