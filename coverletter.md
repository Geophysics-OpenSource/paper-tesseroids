Dear Editor,

The following submission is destined to the Software and Algorithms section of
Geophysics. It describes in detail the algorithm behind the open-source
software "Tesseroids". The software performs gravity forward modeling in
spherical coordinates using tesseroids (spherical prisms). The algorithm uses
an adaptive discretization scheme to achieve accurate computations. The
manuscript also presents a thorough analysis of the numerical error of the
computations. This analysis allowed us to determine the optimal value for a
control parameter of the adaptive discretization.

This submission includes the C-language source code for version 1.2 of the
software. Complementary source code (in the Python language) used in the error
analysis and to generate the figures in the manuscript are submitted in a
separate archive.

I have a question concerning the transfer of copyright of the source code to
the SEG. The software is already distributed under the terms of the open-source
BSD license (included in the source code archive). This license allows
unrestricted re-use by the SEG, provided attribution to the authors is made.
Thus, I do not wish to transfer the copyright of the software to the SEG. Is
that possible? If so, is there any additional step that I am required to take
for this?

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Leonardo Uieda
(on behalf of all authors)
